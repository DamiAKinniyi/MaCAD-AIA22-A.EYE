# **A.EYE**
A.EYE is a tool that uncovers the multiculturalism of Vienna in the allocative scale, showing diversity and inclusivity in terms of age, gender, ethnicity and religion.

Designed for residents, tourists, and immigrants, the tool connects users to Points of Interests (POI) based on their profiles and preferences, and generates optimum routes to selected POIs

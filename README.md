# **A.EYE**
Many cities around the world are fast becoming more and more diverse, and increasingly multicultural;  a mosaic of culture and heritage, blending belief systems, habits, cultures, foods and style from all over the world; making for a rich and vibrant city where difference is celebrated. With increasing diversity, city dwellers will have to negotiate identities and their differences such as language, race, class and many other factors important for self identification, forging connection with city on a personal level, and on the macro scale,diversity representation in formal systems need to capture minority groups for intercultural integration, and inclusivity in cities. A.EYE is a tool that uncovers the multiculturalism of Vienna in the allocative scale, showing diversity and inclusivity in terms of age, gender, ethnicity and religion.

This project tackles the problem in two scales. One on hand, it maps the diversity of vienna, visually showing the ethnicity, age,gender and religious diversity of the city in static layers on a map. On the other hand, it provides a users with a tool that allows them find relatable spaces in the city. Designed for residents, tourists, and immigrants, the tool connects users to Points of Interests (POI) based on their profiles and preferences, and generates optimum routes to selected POIs
